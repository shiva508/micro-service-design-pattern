# Clean Architecture
## This architecture follows dependency inversion.
## Isolate domain logic from outside dependencies.
## It works on the concept of separation of concerns by dividing application into different layers.
## We can use Dependency Inversion(High level modules should not dependent on low level modules) and Polymorphism to create dependency rule to make the domain layer most independent and stable layer.
## Source code dependencies can only point inwards and outwards domain layer.
